## About Me

Hello, I'm Guangyu Wang (王广宇), an undergraduate in Data Science and Big Data Technology at Dongbei University of Finance and Economics, expected to graduate in July 2026. I work as a student member at the Key Laboratory of Big Data Management Optimization and Decision, with interests in spatiotemporal data mining, graph neural networks, and multimodal deep learning.

I enjoy working with computer systems: I have built the Android 6.0 system from source and run a personal NAS with 80TB storage.
